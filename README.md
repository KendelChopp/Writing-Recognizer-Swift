# Writing-Recognizer-Swift
A command line Mac OS program written in Swift to train a neural network for recognizing handwritten numbers using MNIST dataset.

This program generates csv file(s) containing the value of the weights as calculated to create a neural network. These weights can then be used to create a program that takes an image, runs forward propogation, and then recognizes handwritten digits 0-9.
